    <h1>Renewable resource</h1>
    <p>
      A renewable resource, also known as a flow resource,
       is a natural resource
      which will replenish to replace the portion 
      depleted by usage and
      consumption, either through natural reproduction or other recurring
      processes in a finite amount of time in a human 
      time scale. When the
      recovery rate of resources is unlikely to ever exceed a human time scale,
      these are called perpetual resources. Renewable resources are a part of
      Earth's natural environment and the largest components of its ecosphere. A
      positive life-cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's
      sustainability.

    <p>Historically, renewable resources like firewood, latex, guano, charcoal, 
      wood ash, 
      plant colors as indigo, and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed 
      to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era.
      Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable 
      resources as in deforestation, overgrazing or overfishing.

      In addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section,
      livestock farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as tendons, horn, bones, bladders.
      Complex technical constructions as the composite bow were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. 
      The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as Food vs. fuel.
      Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by fief obligations were in so far common in historical times as well. 
      However, a significant percentage of (middle European) farmers yields went into livestock, 
      which provides as well organic fertiliser.
      Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes,
      drove engines as e.g. in treadmills.</p>

       <h2>Sources of Renewable Energy</h2>
       <p>Renewable energy was the main energy source for most of human history
        Throughout most of human history, biomass from plants was the main energy source, which was burned for heat and to feed animals used for transportation and plowing. 
        Nonrenewable sources began replacing most of renewable energy use in the United States in the early 1800s, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/what-is-energy/sources-of-energy.php" target="_blank"
        >click to visit</a> and by the early-1900s, fossil fuels were the main sources of energy. 
        Use of biomass for heating homes remained a source of energy but mainly in rural areas and for supplemental heat in urban areas. 
        In the mid-1980s, use of biomass and other forms of renewable energy began increasing largely because of incentives for their use, 
        especially for electricity generation.
        Many countries are working to increase renewable energy use as a way to help reduce and avoid carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

       <p>An important renewable resource is wood provided by means of forestry,
          which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.
          Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources,  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=avast-a-1&q=sources+of+renewable+energy&oq=sources+of+rene&aqs=avast.1.69i57j0l7.8445j0j9&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank"

        > the main distinction is between energy crops and non-food crops.
          A large variety of lubricants, industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of cotton, copra or hemp, 
          paper derived from wood, rags or grasses, bioplastic are based on plant renewable resources. 
          A large variety of chemical based products like latex, ethanol, resin, 
          sugar and starch can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include fur, leather, 
          technical fat and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. animal glue, tendons, 
         casings or in historical times ambra and baleen provided by whaling.</p>
